## C O A S T R

Coastr is an app built to help improve the efficiency of high capacity bars. Allowing customers to order drinks through their app and the queue of drinks can be viewed by both the user and the business. The business can remove any order from the queue and the customer is able to remove their own order.

This app is designed using the full MERN stack. As well as JWT Token Based Authentication.

Here is [Coastr](https://coastr-app.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku.

Project planning took place on this trello board [Trello](https://trello.com/b/etiUwGFi/coastr)

The Next Steps:
I will be adding payment as well as creating a test business user utilizing a bar owned by someone I know. I will use their menu to tailor a custom menu and database for drinks based on what the bar can provide as well as use images for selecting options. There are also plans to update and improve the UI with animations for when a drink is being filled as well as ETA timers for how long you can expect for your drink to finish. After that will be adding QR code scanning or some other form of quickly letting a bar know that the drink belongs to a specific person.
